## Preface

Google Earth Engine is a cloud-based platform hosted by Google that uses
Google’s high-performance and intrinsically parallel computing system
that subdivides computations across the Google computational
infrastructure, accelerating computational processes (Gorelick et al.,
2017). It has been primarily designed to process and analyze satellite
imagery and geospatial datasets, making computationally demanding
workflows more accessible for research, education and other nonprofit
use at no user cost. Thus, it is totally free.

Up to 2008, using satellite imagery for data analysis was expensive. In
2008, however, the United States Geological Survey (USGS) opted for a
free and open policy on the use of the most popular satellite, Landsat
(Woodcock et al., 2008). The release of Landsat catalog to be freely use
by the public opened enormously the possibilities to expand earth
research (Woulder et al., 2019). However, with so much data available,
the limitation became data processing rather than data gathering.
Personal computers are generally limited in computation power to analyze
the amount of data that a composite of Landsat images require and data
storage is also limited. Supercomputers can do that job, but access them
is only optional for researchers working in certain institutions. Google
opened the option for all users with internet access to operate on a
high computing infrastructure through the new platform, Google Earth
Engine.

When the increase of satellite data accessibility is combined with free
access to fast computing processes, researchers and students have the
possibility to carry out extremely high computing demanding projects in
matter of minutes. For ecologists, this has opened the horizons of
research possibilities in unthinkable ways. And while lot of attention
has been put into the use of Google Earth Engine for remote sensing
scientists (Tamimina et al., 2020), the tool has not reached yet the
spatial ecological field in its full capacity. In this tutorial, we explore
the different applications that this platform provides to analyze data
for projects focused on spatial ecology.

### Goals

This workshop is intended to provide an introduction to GEE for participants 
in the fields of ecology, conservation, and wildlife biology. The course will 
begin by covering the basics of GEE and JavaScript coding before moving on to 
spatial data manipulation and analyses. Participants need no prior experience 
working with GEE, but should have a basic understanding of GIS data and concepts, 
such as raster (including stacks or multi-band images), vectors, projections, and spatial resolution. This course is a continuation of a previous year’s module “Introduction to Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and Wildlife Population Monitoring in R.” At the conclusion of the course, we will combine GEE workflows with population analysis in R, with a goal of creating a community of practitioners that have the skills necessary to expand upon science-based monitoring of wildlife populations across Kenya.

### Learning Outcomes
You are expected to use your own computer for all exercises. By the end of 
this course, you will be able to:

 * Understand GEE’s web interface
 * Access and manipulate spatial data from the GEE catalog
 * Understand the fundamentals of JavaScript code
 * Perform basic spatial data processing (i.e., standard GIS operations)
 * Gain experience with species distribution modeling (i.e., random forest, MaxEnt)
 * Download GEE data to incorporate in R workflows to assess species abundance
 * Use R to create maps and visualize data
 * Make maps that show predictions based on statistical models

### How to use this material

Here we present a tutorial that will guide you on the use of different
model techniques for data analysis. The main goal is that after the workshop, you will be able to continue practicing with this tutorial, and master your skills to analyze your data using Google Earth Engine interface.

The tutorial is organized in 5 main sections. Section 1 is an
introduction to Google Earth Engine and the JavaScript language we use
to code. Section 2 will guide you on the use of images and geometries,
or raster and vector data. Section 3 is an opportunity to lonk GEE with other 
interfaces like R to make visualizations of your data. Section 4 is an introduction 
to the implementation of Species Distribution Models with GEE. Section 5 will
bring us back to Distance Sampling and the use of covariables extracted with GEE in
the modeling process.
